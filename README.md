# api-gateway-express
This is a simple API gateway for nodejs application running on the express framework.

If you're testing things out, building a side project or some simple micro services, it's a good idea to have an API gateway to manage all of your services URLs.

Please do not use this for big and enterprise apps, you may need to use tools like AWS to handle your API, tyke.io and other tools.

## How to use?

Simple clone the project to your local machine and run `npm i` to install the packages. Once done spin up your server by running `npm run dev` - we use nodemon to rerun after file changes.
