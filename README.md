# api-gateway-express
This is a simple API gateway for nodejs application running on the express framework.

If you're testing things out, building a side project or some simple micro services, it's a good idea to have an API gateway to manage all of your services URLs.

Please do not use this for big and enterprise apps, you may need to use tools like AWS to handle your API, tyke.io and other tools.
